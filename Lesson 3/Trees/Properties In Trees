Properties

1. Root -  The topmost node in a tree structure. It has no parent and is the starting point for accessing all other nodes.

       [10]    ← Root
       /     \
      5     15
    /   \    /   \
   3   7 12  18


2. Siblings - Nodes that share the same parent node.

           10
       /          \
     [5]        [15]  ← Siblings
    /    \       /     \
  [3]-[7]   [12]-[18] ← Siblings


3. Path - The sequence of nodes from one node to another, following parent-child relationships.

      [5]    ← Path: 10→5→7
       ↓
      [7]


4. Ancestor - Any node that lies on the path from a given node to the root.

    [10] ← Ancestor of 7
     /
   [5]  ← Ancestor of 7
    \
    [7]  ← Current node


5. Descendant - Any node that can be reached by moving from a given node downward through children.

6. Subtree - A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.

        [10]
      /        \
    [5]       15    ← Subtree rooted at 5
    /   \      /    \

Subtree at 5:

7. Height - is measured from a node upward to the deepest leaf. It's the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf.
        10 (height=2)
      /       \
     5       15 (height=1)
   /   \      /    \
  3   7   12   18 (height=0)


8. Depth - is measured from the root downward to a specific node. It's the number of edges from the root to that node.

        10 (depth=0)
     /       \
    5        15 (depth=1)
   /  \      /   \

9. Parent - The immediate predecessor of a node in the tree.

     /       \
   [5]      15  ← Parent of 3 and 7
   /   \     /   \

10. Children - The immediate successors of a node in the tree.

11. Leaf - A node with no children (terminal node).

         10
      /         \
     5         15
   /   \       /    \
 [3] [7]  [12][18] ← Leaf nodes


12. Cousins -  Nodes at the same depth level but with different parents.
            10
         /       \
       5         15   ← Siblings

Explanation :

Height is the most critical tree property because it directly determines performance efficiency. In C programming, tree height controls the time complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations with balanced height ensuring optimal O(log n) performance. This makes height essential for implementing efficient self-balancing trees and preventing performance degradation in data structures like trees, database indexes, and file systems where speed and scalability are paramount.
